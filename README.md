# Industrial-Copper-Modelling
This project focuses on modelling industrial copper data using Python and various libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn. The objective of the project is to preprocess the data, handle missing values, detect outliers, and handle skewness. Additionally, regression and classification models will be built to predict the selling price and determine if a sale was won or lost. The trained models will be saved as a pickle file for later use in a Streamlit application.

**Key functionalities:**

* **Data exploration and preprocessing:**
    * Analyze skewness in features.
    * Detect and handle outliers.
    * Address data imbalances (if applicable).
    * Handle missing values (e.g., imputation).
    * Feature scaling or transformation (if necessary).
    * Save preprocessed data for further use.

# Usage

1. **Explore Skewness and Outliers**

   Analyze the dataset for skewness and outliers.

2. **Data Transformation and Cleaning**

   Transform the data into a suitable format and perform necessary cleaning.

3. **Data Transformation and Cleaning**

   Transform the data into a suitable format and perform necessary cleaning.

4. **Train Models**

   Train the regression and classification models.

5. **Regression Model (Predict Selling_Price)**:

   Predict the selling price of industrial copper using regression analysis.

6. **Classification Model (Predict Status: WON or LOST)**: 
  
   Predict whether a sale was won or lost using classification analysis.

7. **Evaluate Models**

   Evaluate the performance of the trained models.

8. **Run Streamlit App**

   Launch the Streamlit application to interact with the models and make predictions:


## Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.7 or above)
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## Summary
In this project, I have developed a comprehensive pipeline to preprocess industrial copper data, handle missing values, detect outliers, and address skewness. We built regression and classification models to predict the selling price and determine the outcome of sales. The trained models are saved as pickle files for easy retrieval. The Streamlit application provides a user-friendly interface for utilizing the trained models to make predictions.
